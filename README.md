## University of Sussex - ARC AGI

This project contains code written at the University of Sussex which attempts to get closer to a solution of the ARC AGI challenge.

## Structure

### `matrix_tools.py`

Provides a set of tools for manipulating matrices, such as `Matrix` objects (with methods such as `flip_horizontally()` and `change_colors()`) and `Area` objects (which allow manipulation of sub-matrices).

### `solutions.py`

Contains solutions to some of the puzzles, and checks those solutions against the training and testing examples.
